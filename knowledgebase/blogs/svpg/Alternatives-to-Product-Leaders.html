<p>Original: <a href="https://www.svpg.com/alternatives-to-product-leaders">Alternatives To Product Leaders</a> (Marty Cagan, SVPG blog, 5 Dec 2023)</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>An article is <a onclick="load_in_iframe();">Marty Cagan</a>'s second (of two) reactions on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/brianchesky">Brian Chesky</a>'s (CEO Airbnb) <a href="https://www.lennyspodcast.com/brian-cheskys-new-playbook">"New playbook" interview in Lenny's Podcast</a> (12 Nov 2023) to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lennyrachitsky">Lenny Rachitsky</a> (ex Airbnb Product Lead, Author of <a href="https://www.lennysnewsletter.com">Lenny's Newsletter</a> and <a href="https://www.lennyspodcast.com">Lenny's Podcast</a>).</p>

<h3>TL;DR</h3>
<p>There's no real alternative to strong Product Leaders. Article explains why any known Product Leadership Alternative one might ever seen is a bad alternative both for startups and for established companies. This is the second article on alternatives. First one was about <a href="Alternatives-to-Product-Managers.html">Alternatives To Product Managers</a>.</p>

<h2>Details</h2>
<h3 id="warns">Warns for the people who have never read anything from Marty</h3>
<ul>
<li>If you don't know the difference between <a href="http://www.svpg.com/product-vs-feature-teams">Product Team and Feature Team</a> (Marty Cagan, SVPG blog, 29 August 2019) please read the mentioned document carefully before continue;</li>
<li>There's no right way to build. Please read <a href="https://www.svpg.com/an-svpg-process">SVPG Process</a> (Marty Cagan, SVPG blog, 26 August 2022) where Marty told about it;</li>
<li style="color: lightgray">"My work is all about sharing the practices that try to give you the best chance of product success".</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="no-right-way-to-build-but-what-matters-and-when">No right way to build, but what matters and when (gentle slide from the warns to the main topic)</h3>
<ul>
<li style="color: lightgray">"For early stage startups ... what matters most are the specific individuals involved. They matter more than whether the people are co-located or remote, or what particular roles and responsibilities each person has, or the product vision, or the techniques they use to discover and deliver their product";</li>
<li style="color: lightgray">"But as companies grow, they usually find that they start to run up against the limitations of what these individuals can personally do, so then theyâ€™re looking to find a more scalable and repeatable approach. And thatâ€™s what my work tries to focus on".</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="so-the-alternatives">So, the alternatives</h3>
<ul>
<li>"If you define product management, as I do, as <strong>being responsible for the value and viability of what gets built</strong>, then there really isnâ€™t an alternative to product management â€“ someone is doing this one way or another";</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="feature-teams-product-managers-and-product-owners">ðŸ‘Ž Feature Team Product Manager/Owner as a Product Manager</h4>
<ul>
<li>Product Managers in Feature Teams are Project Managers;</li>
<li>"Agile-trained Product Owners" (Certified Scrum Product Owners, CSPO) are not Product Managers;</li>
<li>These 2 are not alternatives to Product Management.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="founder-stakeholder-product-managers">ðŸ‘Ž Founder/Stakeholder as a Product Manager</h4>
<ul>
<li>They are usually Feature Teams: "the founder/CEO (in a small company), or the stakeholders (in a medium or large company), are taking responsibility for the product management (the value and viability of what is to be built), and the product teams are just there to build out the roadmap features and projects";</li>
<li>And they end-up building waterfall testing ideas way too expensive, way too slow, as described in <a href="http://www.svpg.com/product-fail">Product Fail</a> (Marty Cagan, SVPG blog, 5 June 2015).</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="designer-engineer-as-a-product-manager">ðŸ‘Ž Designer/Engineer as a Product Manager</h4>
<ul>
<li>If they do not cover Product Owner role (which anyone in a team can do), but do a real job of a Product Manager (cover both value and viability of the product), then this is a 2 full-time jobs at once.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="product-leaders-as-product-managers">ðŸ‘Ž Product Leader as a Product Manager</h4>
<ul>
<li>This works great for Apple where Product Leaders are exceptionally strong and they lead product teams;</li>
<li>This is great for Apple - for a company that builds consumer devices and that moves slow (because Product Leaders act as bottlenecks);</li>
<li>You probably don't have Product Leaders with 10-25 years of experience building world-class products in your company, so don't expect same results as in Apple.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusions</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>There's no real alternative to strong Product Managers</b>: "I certainly believe that true product managers ... are the most scalable and sustainable solution to driving consistent innovation on behalf of our customers";</li>
<li>But <b>you need not only Product Managers. You need Product Leaders as well</b> to cover value and viability;</li>
<li>And about it in the next article.</li>
